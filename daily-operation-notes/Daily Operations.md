* EDIT: 
Internships provide opportunities to learn and grown from within the
industry. Understanding the inner workings of a business gives you the
opportunity to see the micro processes that culminate into a fully
functioning corporation. My internship experience not only allowed me to develop my technical skill set, but to also develop keen problem solving strategies to further my value as an asset in the workforce.


Having the opportunity to develop one's self under the leadership of
an industry professional provided me with direction in my career
trajectory. The challenging experience of working in settings that
contrast greatly from academic environments, really sparked my
interest in understanding the ways in which we interact with and
develop everyday technologies. Understanding the daily intricacies of
business operations, added a unique perspective as to how I went about
completing job responsibilities as well as developing my own
independent projects.

* REVISE: 
My internship and employment experiences have allowed me the opportunity to develop a skill-set rooted in the technical space
