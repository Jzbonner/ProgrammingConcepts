# Object Oriented Thought Process 
An in depth looked at Object Oriented Programming Concepts ranging from classes and objects to relational databases and client/server applications. Developers will be able to utilize these notes for practical and real world applicable design patterns in object oriented programming environments. 

## Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts
Object Wrappers are object oriented code that includes other code inside. You can also use object wrappers to wrap functionality such as security features, non-portable hardware features and so on. Developers who can combine the skills of mainframe and web development are in demand. 

An object is an entity that contains both data and behavior. In procedural programming code is placed into totally distinct functions or procedures; these procedures then become "black boxes" where input goes in and output comes out. In object oriented design, the attributes and behaviors are contained within a single object; there is no separation. In structured programming data is often separate from the procedures, at times this data is global (meaning it can be easy to modify that data outside the scope of your code). In Object Oriented design there is no such thing as data that is global. In object oriented programming methods are used to perform operations on the data as well as other actions.
