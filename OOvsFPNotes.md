# Object Oriented vs. Functional Programming 
A reference guide for understanding how Object Oriented design can also exist within the scope of Functional Programming. This will be an in depth look at SOLID principles, functional language paradigms, and behavioral design patterns. A majority of examples in these notes will be illustrated in Java 8. 

## Lambadas: Parameterizing Code by Behavior 
Thinking in terms of functions and parameterizing by behavior rather than state is the the key in differentiating functional programming from object-oriented programming. _Lambada Expressions_ are a concise way of describing anonymous functions. Anonymous inner classes were designed to make it easier for Java programmers to represent and pass around behaviors.
