## Euclidean Algorithm 
The Euclidean Algorithm is a simple method for finding the highest common factor (or Greatest Common Divisor - *GCD*) for two positive integers (i.e. the largest number that divides both of them without a remainder). **Example:** The Greatest Common Divisor of 20 and 30 is *10*. The Greateste Common Divisor of 42, 120, and 285 is *3*.
