## Complex Number
Complex Numbers have a wide variety of applications, like calculation of AC voltage, representation of rotations in 2D, Discrete Fourier Transform, complex geometry and much more. A complex number is a number that can be expressed int he form of `a + b * i`. Where `i` is considered a solution of the equation `x^2 = -1`.
