## Complex Number
Complex Numbers have a wide variety of applications, like calculation of AC voltage, representation of rotations in 2D, Discrete Fourier Transform, complex geometry and much more. A complex number is a number that can be expressed int he form of `a + b * i`. Where `i` is considered a solution of the equation `x^2 = -1`.

### Mathematical Operations 
When working with complex numbers the main focus is to simplify and combine like terms and then apply the standard method of operation. For example:

```
Addition ~ (2 + 3i) + (1 - 6i) ==> (2+1) + (3i - 6i) = 3 - 3i

Subtraction ~ (16i - 5i) ==> (16 - 5)i = 11i 

Multiplication ~ 

Conjugation ~ 
```
