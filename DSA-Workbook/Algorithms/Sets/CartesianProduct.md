## Cartesian Product 
The Cartesian Product of sets means the product of non-empty sets in an ordered way. Or in other words, the collection of all ordered pairs obtained by the product of two non-empty sets. An ordered pair means that two elements are taken from each set. For two non-empty sets (A & B), the first element of the pair is taken from the first set A and the second element is taken from the second set B.
