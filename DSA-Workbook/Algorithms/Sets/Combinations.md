## Combinations

A _Combination_ is a way of selecting members from a grouping, such that
order of selection does not matter (opposite of permutations). When
working with combinations the resulting collection may or may not
contain duplicates or repetitions.

- Combinations with Repetitions

![Diagram 2]()

Where `n` is the number of items to choose from and we choose `r` of
them; repeition allowed order doesn't matter.

- Combinatinos without Repetitions

![Diagram 1]()

Where `n` is the number of things to choose from, and we choose `r` of
them; no repeition order doesn't matter.
