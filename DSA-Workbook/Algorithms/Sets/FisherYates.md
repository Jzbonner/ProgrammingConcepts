## Fisher-Yates Shuffle 
The Fisher Yates Shuffle is an alforithm for generating a random permutation of a finite sequence. The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat; it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no element remains. The algorithm produces and unbiased permutation; an instance where every permutation is equally likely.
