## Tree 
Trees are well known as a non-linear data structure. It doesn't store data in a linear way. It organizes data in a hierarchial way. A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges. A tree is a non-linear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees. There are a different types of tree data structures: 
1. Binary Search Tree 
2. AVL Tree 
3. Red-Black Tree 
4. Segment Tree 
5. Fenwick Tree 

### Terminology Summary 
* Root: the topmost `node` of the `tree` 
* Edge: the link between 2 `nodes` 
* Child: a `node` that has a `parent node`
* Parent: a `node` that has an `edge` to a `child node` 
* Leaf: a `node` that does not have a `child node` in the `tree` 
* Height: the `height` of a `tree` is the length of the longest path to a `leaf` 
* Depth: the `depth` of a `node` is the length of the path to its `root`

##### Binary Search Tree 
Sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: data structures that store "items" in memory. They allow for fast lookup, addition and removal of items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key. Binary search trees keep their eyes in sorted order, so that lookup
