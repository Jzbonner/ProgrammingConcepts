## Linked List 
A data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. In it's simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence during iteration. 

Con: Access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline), and faster access if not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked list.
