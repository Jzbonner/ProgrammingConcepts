## Bloom Filter 
A **Bloom Filter** is a data structure designed to tell you, rapidly and memory efficiently, whether an element is present in a set. A *Bloom Filter* is a probabilistic data structure in that it tells us that the element either _definitely is not_ in the set or _may be_ in the set. The base data structure of a Bloom Filter is a **Bit Vector**:

> A Bloom Filter is derived from a proposed technique for applications where the amount of source data would require an impractically large amount of memory if "conventional" error-free hashing techniques were applied. 

**Properties of Bloom Filters**
1. Unlike a standard hash table, a Bloom Filter of a fixed size can represent a set with an arbitrarily large number of elements 
2. Adding an element never fails, however the false positive rate increases steadily as elements are added until all bits in the filter are set to 1, at which point all queries yield a positive result 
3. Bloom Filters never generate _false negative_ results 
4. Deleting elements from a Bloom Filter is not possible because if we delete a single element by clearing bits at indices generated by k hash functions, it might cause the deletion of other elements 

#### Bloom Filter Functionality 
An empty _bloom filter_ is a bit array of "m" bits all set to zero:

You need "k" number of _hash functions_ to calculate the hashes for a given input. You can control the probability of getting a false positive by controlling the size of the Bloom Filter. More spaces in the bit array means fewer false positives. If
