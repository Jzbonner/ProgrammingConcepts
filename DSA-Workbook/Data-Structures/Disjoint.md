## Disjoint Set 
A **Disjoint Set** is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint subsets. A _union-find algorithm_ is an algorithm that performs two useful operations: 
1. **Find**: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset. 
2. **Union**: Join two subsets into a single subset. 

_Disjoint-Sets_ provide near constant time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set. The _Disjoint-Set_ data structure is useful for quickly testing whether nodes in a graph are connected or not.
