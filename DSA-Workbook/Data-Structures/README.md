# Data Structures and Algorithm Workbook 
This is a resource for learning more about the data structures and algorithms in programming. Hopefully this resource will provide an environment for learning and research concepts that are integral to development in modern day scripting languages (the majority of these notes will be written with an emphasis on Javascript). 

## Data Structure 
A data structure is a data organization, management and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. It is a collection of data values, the relationships among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
